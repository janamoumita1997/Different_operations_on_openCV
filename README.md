# Different_operations_on_openCV

* In this project I have implemented the followings:

  * I have taken the image in jpg/npg/jpeg format from the users
  
  * Then,according to the user input,I have formatted the input image in four ways:
  
                        1)resize the image,
                        
                        2)rotate the image
                        
                        3)increasing brightness and contrast
                        
                        4)Mirror image
